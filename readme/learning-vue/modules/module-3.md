## Lesson 3.1: Working with Directives

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Objective**: Learn how to use directives in Vue.js for enhancing interactivity.

**Topics**:

1. Introduction to Vue directives
2. Commonly used directives
3. Custom directives

**Activities**:

1. Presentation (10 minutes):
   * Explain the concept of Vue directives.
   * Introduce commonly used directives like `v-if`, `v-for`, and `v-on`.
2. Hands-On (15 minutes):
   * Guide students in using these directives in Vue components.
   * Demonstrate how to create custom directives.
3. Q\&A and Discussion (5 minutes):
   * Answer any questions related to Vue directives.
   * Discuss scenarios where custom directives can be useful.

**Homework**:

* Create a Vue component that utilizes common directives and implement a custom directive.

## Lesson 3.2: Conditional Rendering

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Objective**: Understand conditional rendering in Vue components.

**Topics**:

1. Conditional rendering with `v-if` and `v-else`
2. The `v-show` directive
3. Using `v-if` vs. `v-show`

**Activities**:

1. Presentation (10 minutes):
   * Explain conditional rendering using `v-if`, `v-else`, and `v-show`.
   * Discuss the differences between `v-if` and `v-show`.
2. Hands-On (15 minutes):
   * Guide students in creating Vue components that use conditional rendering effectively.
3. Practice and Comparison (5 minutes):
   * Provide exercises for students to practice using both `v-if` and `v-show`.
   * Compare the two directives in terms of use cases.

**Homework**:

* Create a Vue component that utilizes conditional rendering to display content based on certain conditions.

## Lesson 3.3: Lists and Loops

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Objective**: Learn how to work with lists and loops in Vue components.

**Topics**:

1. Iterating over lists with `v-for`
2. List rendering and key management
3. Rendering dynamic lists

**Activities**:

1. Presentation (10 minutes):
   * Explain how to use the `v-for` directive for list rendering.
   * Discuss the importance of keys in list rendering.
2. Hands-On (15 minutes):
   * Guide students in creating Vue components that iterate over lists using `v-for`.
   * Teach key management to avoid rendering issues.
3. Dynamic Lists (5 minutes):
   * Show students how to render dynamic lists based on data.

**Homework**:

* Create a Vue component that uses the `v-for` directive to display a dynamic list of items.

## Assignment: Create an Interactive To-Do List

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Objective**: Apply the knowledge gained from Lessons 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 to build an interactive to-do list using Vue.js.

**Activities**:

1. Assignment Brief (5 minutes):
   * Provide a brief description of the assignment: Create an interactive to-do list that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.
2. Work on Assignment (15 minutes):
   * Students work on building the interactive to-do list.
3. Presentation and Review (10 minutes):
   * Students present their to-do list components to the class and receive feedback.

**Assessment**:

* Assessment of the completed interactive to-do list assignment.
